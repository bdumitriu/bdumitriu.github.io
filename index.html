<p>‘Did you hear what I said?’ Barbara inquired. It was 1968 again.</p>
<p>‘Of course.’ He had been dozing.</p>
<p>‘If you’re going to act like a child, maybe we'll just have to <i>treat</i>
you like a child.’</p>
<p>‘This isn’t what happens next,’ said Billy.</p>
<p>‘We’ll <i>see</i> what happens next.’ Big Barbara now embraced herself. ‘It’s
awfully cold in here. Is the heat on?’</p>
<p>‘The <i>heat</i>?’</p>
<p>‘The furnace—the thing in the basement, the thing that makes hot air that comes
out of these registers. I don’t think it’s working.’</p>
<p>‘Maybe not.’</p>
<p>‘Aren’t you cold?’</p>
<p>‘I hadn’t noticed.’</p>
<p>‘Oh my God, you <i>are</i> a child. If we leave you alone here, you’ll freeze to
death, you’ll starve to death.’ And so on. It was very exciting for her, taking
his dignity away in the name of love.</p>

Children, however magical, are not immune to their parents; and as the
prejudices and world-views of adults began to take over their minds, I found
children from Maharashtra loathing Guajaratis, and fair-skinned northerners
reviling Dravidian ‘blackies’; there were religious rivalries; and class entered
our councils. The rich children turned up their noses at being in such lowly
company; Brahmins began to feel uneasy at permitting even their thoughts to
touch the thoughts of untouchables; while, among the low-born, the pressures of
poverty and Communism were becoming evident... and, on top of all this there
were clashes of personality, and the hundred squalling rows which are
unavoidable in a parliament composed entirely of half-grown brats.
</p>
<br />
<p>
In this way the Midnight Children’s Conference fulfilled the prophecy of the
Prime Minister and became, in truth, a mirror of the nation; the passive-literal
mode was at work, although I railed against it, with increasing desperation, and
finally with growing resignation... ‘Brothers, sisters!’ I broadcast, with a
mental voice as uncontrollable as its physical counterpart, ‘Do not let this
happen! Do not permit the endless duality of masses-and-classes,
capital-and-labour, them-and-us to come between us! We,’ I cried passionately,
‘must be a third principle, we must be the force which drives between the horns
of the dilemma; for only by being other, by being new, can we fulfil the promise
of our birth!’ I had supporters, and none greater than Parvati-the-witch; but I
felt them slipping away from me, each distracted by his or her own life... just
as, in truth, I was being distracted by mine. It was as though our glorious
congress was turning out to be more than another of the toys of childhood, as
though long trousers were destroying what midnight had created... ‘We must
decide on a programme,’ I pleaded, ‘our own Five Year Plan, why not?’ But I
could hear, behind my anxious broadcast, the amused laughter of my greatest
rival; and there was Shiva in all our heads, saying scornfully, ‘No, little
rich boy; there is no third principle; there is only money-and-poverty, and
have-and-lack, and right-and-left; there is only me-against-the-world! The world
is not ideas, rich boy; the world is no place for dreamers; the world, little
Snotnose, is things. Things and their makers rule the world; look at Birla, and
Tata, and all the powerful: they make things. For things, the country is run.
Not for people. For things, America and Russia send aid; but five hundred
million stay hungry. When you have things, then there is time to dream; when you
don’t, you fight.’ The Children, listening fascinatedly as we fought... or
perhaps not, perhaps even our dialogue failed to hold their interest. And now I:
‘But people are not things; if we come together, if we love each other, if we
show that this, just this, this people-together, this Conference, this
children-sticking-together-through-thick-and-thin, can be that third way...’ But
Shiva, snorting: ‘Little rich boy, that’s all just wind. All that
importance-of-the-individual. All that possibility-of-humanity. Today, what
people are is just another kind of thing.’ And I, Saleem, crumbling: ‘But...
free will... hope... the great soul, otherwise known as <i>mahatma</i>, of
mankind... and what of poetry, of art, and...’ Whereupon Shiva seized his
victory: ‘You see? I knew you’d turn out to be like that. Mushy, like overcooked
rice. Sentimental as a grandmother. Go, who wants your rubbish? We all have
lives to live. Hell’s bells, cucumber-nose, I’m fed up with your Conference.
It’s got nothing to do with one single thing.’

It had already occurred to me that our family believed implicitly in good
business principles; they expected a handsome return for their investment in
me. Children get food shelter pocket-money longholidays and love, all of it
apparently free gratis, and most of the little fools think it's a sort of
compensation for having been born. 'There are no strings on me!' they sing;
but I, Pinocchio, saw the strings. Parents are impelled by the profit motive —
nothing more, nothing less. For their attentions, they expected, from me, the
immense dividend of greatness. Don't misunderstand. I didn't mind. I was, at 
that time, a dutiful child. I longed to give them what they wanted, [...]; I
simply did not know how. Where did greatness come from? How did you get some?
<i>When?</i>...

Nobody was surprised that there were accidents ... well, there were a few voices
saying, if this is the country we dedicated to our God, what kind of God is it
that permits — but these voices were silenced before they had finished their
questions, kicked on the shins under the tables, for their own sakes, because
there are things that cannot be said. No, it's more than that: there are things
that cannot be permitted to be true.

This particular last day of April falls in a year very nearly equidistant from
1689, the culmination of the English Revolution, and 1789, the start of the French;
in a sort of dozing solstitial standstill, a stasis of the kind predicted by those
today who see all evolution as a punctuated equilibrium, between those two zenith
dates and all they stand for; at a time of reaction from the intemperate extremisms
of the previous century, yet already hatching the seeds [...] of the world-changing
upheaval to come. Certainly England as a whole was indulging in its favourite and
sempiternal national hobby: retreating deep within itself, and united only in a
constipated hatred of change of any kind.

After they had finished Doc lay back in the pine needles, and a fine peacefulness
settled on him. The air, the softness of the needles, the odors of kelp and pine

Dar ce dezamăgire și deziluzie mi-a adus universitatea, la care voiam să studiez
științele politice! Tonul uzual al studenților, nivelul culturii lor generale și
comportarea lor în societate, felul de a fi a unor profesori, ce mult contrastau
toate acestea cu ceea ce mă obișnuisem la voi! Îți aduci aminte cum apăram
odinioară lumea noastră împotriva celei a voastre și cum, făcând asta, lăudam
adesea în gura mare viața naivă, nealterată. Dacă aceasta merita o pedeapsă,
prietene, atunci eu am fost greu pedepsit. Căci această viață instinctuală,
naivă, inocentă, această stare de copilărie și genialitate nedresată a celor
naivi va fi existând poate pe undeva, la țărani poate sau la meșteșugari, ori
altundeva, dar eu n-am reușit s-o văd la față sau să fiu părtaș la ea. Îți mai
amintești, de asemenea, nu-i așa, cum criticam în luările mele de cuvânt
prezumția și orgoliul castalienilor, această castă încrezută și moleșită, cu
spiritul ei de castă și cu îngâmfarea ei aristocratică. Ei, bine, oamenii de
lume nu erau mai puțini mândri de manierele lor grosolane, de cultura lor
precară, de umorul lor grobian și zgomotos, de limitarea lor viclean-prostească
la țeluri practice și egoiste, în naturalețea lor de oameni cu fruntea îngustă
se socoteau nu mai puțin prețioși, iubiți de Dumnezeu și distinși decât ar fi
putut s-o facă vreodată cel mai afectat elev-model de la Waldzell.

So refreshing, to find politeness and consideration in girls of that age. Too
often [...] they display only thoughtless ingratitude. But thoughtless
ingratitude is the armor of the young; without it, how would they ever get
through life? The old wish the young well, but they wish them ill also: they
would like to eat them up, and absorb their vitality, and remain immortal
themselves. Without the protection of surliness and levity, all children would
be crushed by the past — the past of others, loaded onto their shoulders.

Un bun exemplu îl oferă potopul chinezesc (japonezii, la fel ca africanii, nu
cunosc existența Potopului). Acesta seamnă mai curând cu o catastrofă obișnuită

de niște zei inaccesibili. Pe deasupra, lucru nemaiauzit, împotriva
cataclismului se organizează o opoziție, dirijată de anumiți eroi mitici. Se
ridică baraje, se sapă canale, iar, în cele din urmă, apele sunt obligate să se
retragă. Fataliști, chinezii? Rămâne de văzut...
