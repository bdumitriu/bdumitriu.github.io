<p>Rubashov said nothing and looked at Gletkin with renewed interest. What was
that? Was the Neanderthal opening his soul? But Gletkin sat stiffly on his
chair, his eyes as expessionless as ever.</p>
<p>‘You may be right about many things,’ Rubashov said at last. ‘But you
provoked me. What use is it to be constantly searching out scapegoats, when the
real problems are fundamental, and rooted in the causes you have just described
so convincingly?’</p>
<p>‘Experience teaches,’ said Gletkin, ‘that the masses need to be given simple
explanations for complicated connections that are difficult to understand —
explanations that are easily grasped. From what I’ve learned of history I see
that mankind has never managed without scapegoats. I believe this has always
been an indispensible institution; your friend Ivanov taught me that its origins
lie in religion. As far as I remember he explained that the word comes from a
custom of the Israelites, who several times a year would make a sacrifice to
their god of a goat that had been ritually burdened with their sins.’ Gletkin
paused and adjusted his cuffs. ‘Incidentally history also has examples of
voluntary scapegoats. When I was the same age as you were when you were given
your watch, the priest taught me that Jesus Christ called himself a lamb and
took all the sins of the world. I never understood how it was supposed to
lighten the fate of mankind if someone declares he is letting himself be
crucified in its name. But for two thousand years people have considered this
entirely natural.’</p>
<p>Rubashov looked at him, What was Gletkin getting at? What was the point of
this conversation? In what logical labyrinth had his Neanderthal logic lost its
way?</p>
<p>‘Even so,’ said Rubashov, ‘it would be more suited to our view to tell people
the plain truth rather than populate the world with saboteurs and devils.’</p>
<p>‘If the people of my village,’ said Gletkin, ‘were told that they were
sluggish and backward despite the revolution and the factory, nothing would be
attained. If they are told that they are heroes of labour, more diligent and
efficient than the Americans, and that everything bad is solely due to the
devils and saboteurs, then at least something can be achieved. What is true is
what serves mankind, and whatever harms it is a lie. The party’s primer of world
history published for use in the adult night schools makes a point of saying
that during its first centuries, the Christian religion brought some measure of
objective progress for humanity. No reasonable person is interested in whether
Christ was lying or speaking the truth when he claimed he was the son of a god
and a virgin. People said this was symbolic, but the peasants took it literally.
We have the same right to invent useful symbols that the peasants take
literally.’</p>
<p>‘Your logic,’ said Rubashov, ‘sometimes reminds me of Ivanov’s.’</p>
<p>‘Citizen Ivanov,’ said Gletkin, ‘belonged like you to the old intelligentsia,
so that in conversations with him I was able to acquire historical knowledge I
never had due to inadequate schooling. The difference is that I take pains to
think logically in the service of the party; Citizen Ivanov, however, was a
cynic.’</p>
<p>‘Was?’ asked Rubashov, taking off his pince-nez.</p>
<p>‘Citizen Ivanov,’ said Gletkin, fixing his expressionless eyes on Rubashov, ‘was
shot last night following an administrative proceeding.’</p>

<p>“Epoca sovietică...” Cuvântul avea un statut sacru, magic. Și, din inerție,
în bucătăriile intelectuale încă se vorbea spre Pasternak, făceai supă fără să
lași din mână volume de Astafiev sau de Bîkov, dar viața demonstra mereu că
lucrurile astea nu mai aveau importanță. Cuvintele nu înseamnă nimic. În ’91...
Am internat-o pe mama în spital cu o pneumonie gravă și ea s-a întors de-acolo
eroină, nu închisese gura o clipă. Povestise depre Stalin, despre asasinarea lui
Kirov, despre Buharin... Ar fi ascultat-o zi și noapte. Pe atunci oamenii voiau
să li se deschidă ochii. De curând însă a fost din nou internată în spital și,
cât a stat acolo, a tăcut. N-au trecut decât vreo cinci ani, și realitatea deja
a împărțit altfel rolurile. De data asta eroina a fost nevasta unui mare om de
afaceri... Toți se minunau de povestirile ei... Ce casă are — trei sute de metri
pătrați! Câți servitori: bucătăreasă, bonă, șofer, grădinar... Se duce în
concediu cu soțul în Europa... Muzee — firește, dar buticurile... Buticurile! Un
inel avea atâtea carate, celălalt... Pandantive... Clipsuri de aur... Avea un
succes de public imens. Despre Gulag sau despre alte asemenea, nici un cuvânt.
Bine, toate astea or fi fost cândva. Dar ce rost are să te mai cerți cu

<p>Children, however magical, are not immune to their parents; and as the
prejudices and world-views of adults began to take over their minds, I found
children from Maharashtra loathing Guajaratis, and fair-skinned northerners
reviling Dravidian ‘blackies’; there were religious rivalries; and class entered
our councils. The rich children turned up their noses at being in such lowly
company; Brahmins began to feel uneasy at permitting even their thoughts to
touch the thoughts of untouchables; while, among the low-born, the pressures of
poverty and Communism were becoming evident... and, on top of all this there
were clashes of personality, and the hundred squalling rows which are
unavoidable in a parliament composed entirely of half-grown brats.</p>
<p>In this way the Midnight Children’s Conference fulfilled the prophecy of the
Prime Minister and became, in truth, a mirror of the nation; the passive-literal
mode was at work, although I railed against it, with increasing desperation, and
finally with growing resignation... ‘Brothers, sisters!’ I broadcast, with a
mental voice as uncontrollable as its physical counterpart, ‘Do not let this
happen! Do not permit the endless duality of masses-and-classes,
capital-and-labour, them-and-us to come between us! We,’ I cried passionately,
‘must be a third principle, we must be the force which drives between the horns
of the dilemma; for only by being other, by being new, can we fulfil the promise
of our birth!’ I had supporters, and none greater than Parvati-the-witch; but I
felt them slipping away from me, each distracted by his or her own life... just
as, in truth, I was being distracted by mine. It was as though our glorious
congress was turning out to be more than another of the toys of childhood, as
though long trousers were destroying what midnight had created... ‘We must
decide on a programme,’ I pleaded, ‘our own Five Year Plan, why not?’ But I
could hear, behind my anxious broadcast, the amused laughter of my greatest
rival; and there was Shiva in all our heads, saying scornfully, ‘No, little
rich boy; there is no third principle; there is only money-and-poverty, and
have-and-lack, and right-and-left; there is only me-against-the-world! The world
is not ideas, rich boy; the world is no place for dreamers; the world, little
Snotnose, is things. Things and their makers rule the world; look at Birla, and
Tata, and all the powerful: they make things. For things, the country is run.
Not for people. For things, America and Russia send aid; but five hundred
million stay hungry. When you have things, then there is time to dream; when you
don’t, you fight.’ The Children, listening fascinatedly as we fought... or
perhaps not, perhaps even our dialogue failed to hold their interest. And now I:
‘But people are not things; if we come together, if we love each other, if we
show that this, just this, this people-together, this Conference, this
children-sticking-together-through-thick-and-thin, can be that third way...’ But
Shiva, snorting: ‘Little rich boy, that’s all just wind. All that
importance-of-the-individual. All that possibility-of-humanity. Today, what
people are is just another kind of thing.’ And I, Saleem, crumbling: ‘But...
free will... hope... the great soul, otherwise known as <i>mahatma</i>, of
mankind... and what of poetry, of art, and...’ Whereupon Shiva seized his
victory: ‘You see? I knew you’d turn out to be like that. Mushy, like overcooked
rice. Sentimental as a grandmother. Go, who wants your rubbish? We all have
lives to live. Hell’s bells, cucumber-nose, I’m fed up with your Conference.
It’s got nothing to do with one single thing.’</p>

<p>Dar ce dezamăgire și deziluzie mi-a adus universitatea, la care voiam să
studiez științele politice! Tonul uzual al studenților, nivelul culturii lor

mult contrastau toate acestea cu ceea ce mă obișnuisem la voi! Îți aduci aminte
cum apăram odinioară lumea noastră împotriva celei a voastre și cum, făcând

cuvânt prezumția și orgoliul castalienilor, această castă încrezută și moleșită,
cu spiritul ei de castă și cu îngâmfarea ei aristocratică. Ei, bine, oamenii de
lume nu erau mai puțini mândri de manierele lor grosolane, de cultura lor
precară, de umorul lor grobian și zgomotos, de limitarea lor viclean-prostească
la țeluri practice și egoiste, în naturalețea lor de oameni cu fruntea îngustă
se socoteau nu mai puțin prețioși, iubiți de Dumnezeu și distinși decât ar fi
